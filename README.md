Machine Learning Approaches to Classify PCOS Phenotypes from Lifestyle and Clinical Indicators

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a complex hormonal and metabolic disorder affecting an estimated 10–13% of women worldwide (Oehlschlaeger, 2025). It is characterized by hormonal imbalances, ovarian cysts, and heterogeneous metabolic symptoms such as insulin resistance, inflammation, and dysregulated stress hormones. Importantly, PCOS does not present as a single uniform condition but manifests through multiple phenotypes including insulin-resistant, inflammatory, adrenal, and post-pill PCOS which is each associated with distinct symptom patterns and intervention needs. Despite advances in endocrinology, current diagnostic practices remain heavily dependent on clinical and imaging tests, leaving a gap in early identification based on lifestyle and behavioral indicators.
Recent studies have demonstrated the promise of machine learning (ML) in PCOS diagnosis. Oehlschlaeger (2025) reports that gradient-boosting models achieved near-perfect predictive performance (AUC = 0.9947) when combining ultrasound, Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH), and clinical features. However, the authors caution that such performance may be influenced by data leakage, overfitting, or reliance on invasive clinical measurements that limit generalizability across populations. Additionally, existing work focuses primarily on binary diagnosis rather than distinguishing PCOS phenotypes, leaving a critical gap in personalized risk stratification and intervention planning.
Building upon these studies, the proposed thesis shifts the focus from diagnosis to phenotype classification, aiming to predict PCOS subtypes using non-invasive, lifestyle-driven data. The project will use self-reported and survey-based variables such as dietary patterns, physical activity, sleep quality, perceived stress, menstrual irregularities, and dermatological symptoms. These features are more accessible than ultrasound or hormonal assays and may enable earlier detection of phenotype-specific risk profiles.
Methodologically, this study will employ supervised machine learning classifiers, allowing model selection to be driven by exploratory data analysis and empirical performance rather than predetermined assumptions. Classical machine learning approaches will be benchmarked alongside ensemble methods, including stacking models that integrate multiple learners. If data scale permits, artificial neural networks will also be explored. In addition, this project will investigate Transformer-based architectures for tabular data, such as TabTransformer models, enabling a comparative evaluation between conventional ML methods and emerging deep learning approaches increasingly used in health analytics. Model evaluation will incorporate cross-validation, strict train–validation–test splits, and feature isolation strategies to minimize data leakage and improve robustness.
Data for this project will be sourced from publicly available PCOS-related datasets and health survey repositories, supplemented by curated feature engineering to approximate phenotype labels where direct clinical annotation is unavailable. While acknowledging limitations in phenotype ground truth, the study will emphasize transparency, reproducibility, and cautious interpretation. Generalizability will be assessed through stratified evaluation across demographic and behavioral subgroups, with an emphasis on model stability rather than peak accuracy alone.
The creative component of this project will take the form of an interactive web-based application that visualizes model outputs and feature contributions for each PCOS phenotype. The deployed interface will be implemented using tools such as Streamlit or FastAPI and willppo allow users to explore how different lifestyle patterns influence predicted phenotype likelihoods. Rather than serving as a diagnostic tool, the dashboard will function as an educational and exploratory platform, translating complex model behavior into intuitive, human-centered data stories.
By integrating rigorous machine learning methodology with transparent data storytelling, this project aims to contribute both analytically and socially. It advances PCOS research by addressing phenotype heterogeneity while offering an accessible framework for understanding how everyday behaviors interact with women’s hormonal health diversity.
